### How to check whether our Intel-based Mac has a 32-bit or 64-bit processor?

Three methods to find out if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit Intel-based Mac:

**Method one: [](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201948)<https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201948>**

* Hold down the Option key and choose System Information or System Profiler from the Apple menu.
* Select the Hardware section of the window that appears.
* Locate the Processor Name.
* Compare your Processor Name to information below to determine whether your Mac has a 32-bit or 64-bit processor.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Method 2:**

Go to the Apple Menu and select "About this Mac". If it says Core Duo, then it is 32-bit CPU. If it says Core 2 Duo, Xeon, i3, i5, i7, anything else, then it is 64bit CPU. (Ignore the 32bit kernel issue, it will run 64bit software just fine).

**Method 3:**

Physically, if your MBP has a black keyboard, it is absolutely 64bit. The original MBPs had a silver keyboard and the 32bit units were all but replaced in early 2007\. So if you purchased your model even in the later course of 2007, then it is a Mac capable of running 64bit. Also, if you are running Lion, then you are 64bit (as Lion does not run on 32bit Macs)

### How do I check whether a Mac app is 32-bit or 64-bit?

From the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, then click the System Report button. From the system report, scroll down to Software, then select Applications. When you select an individual application, you will see a field titled "64-bit (Intel) ". "Yes" indicates 64-bit; "No" indicates 32-bit.

### Differences between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems and programs

* A 32-bit operating system typically only allows for up to about 4 gigabytes of RAM to be utilized by the OS or any of the installed programs. Therefore, it makes sense to only install 32-bit programs on a 32-bit operating system, as a 64-bit program would not be able to access any more RAM than a 32-bit program on a 32-bit operating system.
* A 64-bit operating system allows for much higher RAM access and capacity. See your specific operating system specifications for further information on how much memory (RAM) can be utilized by your specific OS.
* Mac 32-bit operating system can run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs.
* Mac 64-bit operating system can run 64-bit programs, Mac OS 64-bit 10.14 (Mojave) version or lower version can run 32-bit programs, Mac OS 64-bit 10.14 (Mojave) higher version will not run 32-bit programs.
* Windows 64-bit operating system can run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs;
* Windows 32-bit operating system can only run 32-bit programs but not 64-bit programs.
