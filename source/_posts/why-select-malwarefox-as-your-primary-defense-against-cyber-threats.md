### Pro-Active Technology

Antivirus programs rely on signature based technology for detection purpose; so it works only when certain infection is in their database. 

This method is not effective for unknown malware responsible for Zero-day attacks. Moreover, it works only when the threat is executed. On other hand, MalwareFox employs heuristic technology and behavior detection along with cloud power which enabled it to detect almost any kind of malware even before it can act or infect the system.
