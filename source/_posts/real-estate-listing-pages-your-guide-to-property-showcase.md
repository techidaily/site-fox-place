* Same location on the dialog

**The properties are grouped in the following categories:**

* Minimize - The dialog can be minimized.
* SystemModal - If this flag is set, no other application can take the focus. This state remains until the dialog is dismissed.
* KeepModeless - If true, the other dialogs stay alive when this dialog box is created.
* Track Disk Space - If true, the dialog box periodically calls the installer. If the property changes, it notifies the controls on the dialog. This style can be used if there is a control on the dialog indicating disk space.

* Integer - If this flag is set, the associated property is an integer.
* Left Scroll - The scroll bar is displayed on the control's left side.

* Show Rollback - Specify whether or not the rollback backup files are included in the costs displayed by the Volume Cost List control.
* Fixed Image Size - When this attribute is "true" the image maintains its original size even if the control window bounds are different. Otherwise, the image is scaled to fit the control window. This attribute is ignored if you have enabled the option "Always stretch images to fir their control window bounds" or "Always use original image sizes, regardless of control window bounds", from [Themes](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) page.
* Elevation Shield - Specify if Windows Vista or above will show an elevation shield on the button. This is a visual element which will inform the user that he will need to provide Administrator privileges after clicking on the button.

The following attributes are available for Text type controls.

* Format Size - If this flag is set for a static text control, the control automatically attempts to format the displayed text as a number that represents a count of bytes. For proper formatting, the control's text must be set to a string that represents a number expressed in units of 512 bytes. The displayed value is then formatted in kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB), and displayed with the appropriate string that represents the units.
* No Prefix - If TRUE, the "&" character's occurrence in a text is displayed as itself. If FALSE, then the character following "&" in the text string is displayed underscored.
