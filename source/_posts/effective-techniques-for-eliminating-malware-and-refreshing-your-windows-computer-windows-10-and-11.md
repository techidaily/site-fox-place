## What is a Malware?

Malware is the short form for referring a Malicious Software that can be used to compromise a PC. To put it in a clearer manner: It is considered to be an exasperating or destructive type of software, which creates security threats without the users’ permission.

There are numerous [types of these malicious](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) programs that are very much enough to put you at absolute security risks. The list includes viruses, Spyware, worm, Phishing, Trojan horse, [Ransomware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), Backdoors, Rootkits, [Keyloggers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), Grayware, etc.

## Warning Signs of Malware Infection

These malicious software programs can perform a variety of functions, such as deleting sensitive data; encrypting; altering; stealing; monitoring users’ activity without their permission, and even hijacking the core computing functions. If you’re fretting to know, whether you have a malware infection on your Windows PC; check for the following indications.

The [signs of malware infections](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) can wildly vary based on the awful activities it does on your Windows PC. They include considerably slowed-down PC performance, consistent and deliberate ad pop-ups. Sometimes your system gets crashed unwanted, websites or programs are automatically accessed without your input. You also see unusual error notifications, and the battery drains quickly.

The symptoms include unfamiliar icons on desktop, anti-virus protections automatically getting deactivated, and running out of hard drive space, for no proper reason.

If you’re already experiencing all these issues, then your PC is probably affected by malware programs. The only fruitful way to remove malware from Windows for sure is using effective anti-malware software.

## How to Remove Malware from Windows 10?

### **Step 1: Switch over the PC to Safe mode**

Safe mode is a special way to predict the system-critical problem, which interrupts the normal operation of Windows. So, safe mode is an alternate boot method that makes it easier to diagnose malware infection. There are minimum programs and services in Safe Mode

So, if any malware started to load automatically into your PC, it will remove the files which are not running or active. Let’s see the steps to [switch over your PC to Safe Mode](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/).

* For this, Login into your Windows PC and click the “start” button and tap the “Power” Hold on the Shift key, and select _“Reboot”._
* From the full-screen menu, select the _“troubleshooting”_ and then the _“Advanced Options”,_ then opt for _“Startup Settings”._ So, once getting into the Startup Settings screen, tap the _“restart”_ button from the list of settings options.
* Next, you’ll see the window with numbered options, which is hinted as _“press a number to choose from the options below”_. You can select number _“4” (Enable Safe mode)_ to enter into the Safe Mode.

After entering into the Safe Mode, you may find that your system runs faster, and then this is all because of the malware infection. Still, the malware persists in your PC, then follow the upcoming methods.
